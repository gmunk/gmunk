- 👋 Hi, I’m Todor or @gmunk
- 👀 I’m interested in a lot of things frankly. These days I like and dabble in creative coding and a bit of AI.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning rust
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything and everything, drop me a line :).
- 📫 If you want you can reach me [here](mailto:videvt@gmail.com)

For anyone lurking, I have had this account for a long time, not doing anything special, just idling.
However I have decided that I willl try to share most of the things I find interesting 
and spend time working on with the community. Trying to be more social, hopefuly opensource will help me with that.
